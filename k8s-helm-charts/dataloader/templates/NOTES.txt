This service is a download only service, which aims at emulating a batch data ingest service. There is no interaction with it.

Monitor the status of the job with: 

kubectl logs -f $(kubectl get pod -o name -l app={{ .Values.dataLoader.service.name }})

This can take a LOT of time (about 3 days) so be patient.
